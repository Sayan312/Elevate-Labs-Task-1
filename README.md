# Elevate-Labs-Task-1
Here I have done some basic Cleaning of a data that I downloaded from Chatgpt using Excel.

Steps :
1. I have first downloaded the raw data for cleaning in csv format.
2. Checked for the empty values , Typos , Blank Rows , Data Types.
3. Realised that the date column had incompatible data types and formats.
4. First fixed the format to MM/DD/YYYY for each cell that didn't follow the order.
5. Selected the entire column to Change the format to Date.
6. Deleted the row with ID 10 since it had no values in it apart from only the id value.
7. Changed a typo in emails
8. Changed the text "Thirty" to 30 below Age and changed the type to number.
9. Entered random names, emails , age and salary for ID 2,3,4.
10. Made the data more visually representable.
